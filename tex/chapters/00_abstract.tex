Increasing requirements and thus higher complexity in the software industry have required a shift from monolithic software architecture to a microservice landscape to improve scalability and reduce the time to market. While the overall complexity of the systems increases and the complexity of the single services decreases, there is a shift of complex structures towards infrastructure components that host these services. This paper sheds light on a technology called service meshes that can simplify these infrastructure tasks by providing reusable, declarative ways to manage common requirements such as canary deployments or access control in an \textsc{Kubernetes} environment.
