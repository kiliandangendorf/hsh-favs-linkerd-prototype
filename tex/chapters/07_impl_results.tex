\section{Results}

Put results of playing around with service mesh here...

\subsection{Showcases Implementation}
This is what the showcases called in \autoref{sec:showcases-1} look like with \linkerd{}.

\subsubsection{Encryption}
TBD
\begin{itemize}
	\item out-of-box mit Linkerd 
		\item if not wished, deactivate by: \\
			\lstinline|linkerd install --disable-identity --disable-tap|
	\item but pay attention: then there is no encryption for nothing (tap, metrices, etc.), not only communication between services.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Canary Deployment}
TBD

\subsubsection{Access Policies}
TBD

\subsubsection{Load Balancing}
TBD
\begin{itemize}
	\item integrated in \linkerd{}
	\item if ingress is "injected", honor;)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Central monitoring and logging}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Monitoring comes "out-of-box"
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \linkerd{} brings \textsc{Prometheus} and \textsc{Grafana}
		\item  Now we can see \textbf{who} is talking \textbf{how much} to \textbf{whom}
		\item Maybe show a call-tree from linkerd-dashboard?
	\end{itemize}

	\item Logging (\lstinline|linkerd logs|) by linkerd was removed, since it was the same as logs from \lstinline|kubectl|\\
	(\url{https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/discussions/5790})
	\item How to use \lstinline|kubectl|?\\
		\lstinline|kubectl logs <pod> <service>|
	\item here the \lstinline|bash-completion| is very useful (see appendix)
	\item often read: \textsc{Loki} as logging solution...?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item easy to embed into  Grafana
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Pitfalls}
...and lessons learned?
\begin{itemize}
	\item \linkerd{} says, it'll need only 2GB of RAM 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item that was not enough. K8s was crashing
		\item With 4 GB it works
	\end{itemize}

	\item Minikube
	\begin{itemize}
		\item use command to build docker images into minikube-environment to be available in K8s.
	\end{itemize}

	\item Bring some time...
	\item use bash-completion
	\item Use ssh-port-forwarding to communicate with dashboard on VPS	
\end{itemize}
