\section{Introduction}

A microservice is an autonomous service that maps a small task of a specific domain and provides message-based communication through a well-defined interface \cite[p. 18]{microservices-general}.

High autonomy, cohesion, and interoperability are among the quality characteristics of a microservice. High autonomy of microservices ensures that the application is independent, self-contained, and fail-safe. High cohesion is hoped to increase maintainability and fast localization of errors. Interoperability ensures speeding up integrations \cite[p. 208 ff.]{microservices-general}.

Powerful microservices frameworks such as Spring Boot or Spring Cloud represent common solutions for microservices development. Key goals such as high availability, scalability, and resilience are achieved by providing services such as circuit breaking, load balancing, and API gateways \cite{spring-cloud}.

However, this contradicts the technology independence approach \cite{from-monolith} to microservices. This paper aims to shed light on whether and how service meshes can provide a solution to this problem.
